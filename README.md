# The Wild Oasis
Wild Oasis is a hotel management app built for staff to seamlessly handle cabin bookings, check-ins, and check-outs. It offers secure access via Supabase authentication, ensuring only authorized personnel can manage operations. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Supabase authentication and efficiently managing remote states with React Query, improving my skills in building secure and dynamic applications.
